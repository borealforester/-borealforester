# IYKYK – The Hidden Bases Trilogy

**Yesterday. Today. Tomorrow.**  
Three interlocking stories. One long confession.

This repository contains the complete **Hidden Bases Trilogy** — a single PDF compiling three short books that trace the buried history of cryptographic money, surveillance ledgers, and forbidden computing architectures.

### The Trilogy

1. **Yesterday: The First Kill**  
   How perfect privacy money (DigiCash / Chaumian eCash) was strangled in the 1990s so Bitcoin could be born a decade later. The original sin, the gray suits, the scattering of the code.

2. **Today: The Silent Protocol**  
   The 2008–2011 handover. The mutation from privacy dream to public ledger. The quiet clean-up of the inheritors. The ledger that watches everything.

3. **Tomorrow: Eightfold Path**  
   The return of the third state. Ternary computers (Setun, Malbolge, Nutes). The ghost of Brusentsov resurrected in modern AI quantization and suppressed esolangs. The base the world tried to erase is now the most efficient path forward.

All three are one story:  
Privacy was murdered → surveillance money rose from the corpse → the forbidden base returns to power the cage.

### Why This Exists

There are thousands of Bitcoin origin theories, esolang archives, and conspiracy threads scattered across the internet.  
But nothing connects them like this.  
Nothing traces the deliberate kill of DigiCash → the public ledger replacement → the ternary revival for energy-starved AI.

This is not a history book.  
This is a mirror.

Read it if you know what you’re looking for.  
Ignore it if you don’t.
